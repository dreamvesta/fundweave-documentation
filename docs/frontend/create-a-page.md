# FundWeave Frontend Architecture

## Introduction

The frontend of FundWeave is designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing, providing users with a seamless experience as they navigate through the platform. This document outlines the frontend architecture and the main components involved.

## Technology Stack

The primary technology for building the frontend is React.js, a JavaScript library widely used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows us to create reusable UI components.

CSS and HTML are used for styling and structuring the website, respectively, while JavaScript handles dynamic content and interaction with the backend.

## Main Components

### Homepage

This is the first page users see when they visit the site. It includes an overview of the platform, featured projects, and a registration/login prompt.

### User Registration/Login

This component handles user registration and login. It involves forms for inputting user information and credentials and communicates with the backend to create or authenticate users.

### Project Listing

This component displays a list of crowdfunding projects. Each project card includes key information such as the project title, description, funding goal, and current amount raised.

### Project Detail Page

When a user clicks on a project, they're taken to a detailed project page. This includes more in-depth information about the project, its funding goal, the amount raised so far, and an option to invest.

### User Dashboard

Registered users have a dashboard where they can view their investments, track project progress, and manage their account settings.

### Transaction History

This component shows a log of all the transactions a user has made on the platform, providing transparency and traceability.

## State Management

State management is a crucial aspect of React applications. For FundWeave, we use Redux for managing the state of the application. Redux helps manage global state - data that is used across many components of the app.

## Communication with Backend

Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, is used for making requests to the backend. It interacts with the REST API endpoints exposed by the backend.

## Routing

React Router is used for routing in the application. It allows us to set up routes to map to different components based on the URL.

## Security

Security is a crucial aspect of the frontend architecture. We implement HTTPS for secure communication, use JWT tokens for user authentication, and ensure that sensitive user data is handled securely.

## Responsive Design

The frontend is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Conclusion

This document provides a general overview of the frontend architecture of FundWeave. The exact implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and constraints of the project. The key aim is to create a secure, user-friendly, and interactive interface for users to participate in crowdfunding projects easily and transparently.
